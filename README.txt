Level Up and Game Over

        For every 3x10 fruit blocks you eliminate, you will level up (Unfortunately, 
there are no combos, such as 4 in a row or 5 in a row). When you level up, the speed 
of descent will increase to 750/level milliseconds. Also, if you opened the game via 
the terminal, the terminal will notify you when you levelled up and to what level.
        The terminal will also notify you when your game has ended (e.g., when a new 
piece cannot fit onto the board), and will exit the game.


Right Click Menu

        A menu will appear when you right-click the game window.  Here is what these 
options do:

Restart - restarts the game

Skip to level - You have a choice of skipping to level 1, 3, 5, or 7. When chosen, 
the game will restart.

Disable/Enable row deletion - When enabled, each row that is full will be deleted, 
and the above tiles will shift down. This makes the game harder to lose.

Disable/Enable falling tiles - When disabled, tiles will stay as tetris shapes when 
settled, rather than falling as individual tiles if there is room underneath. This 
mode will leave many floating tiles. 

Quit - exits game


Bugs

Restarting - tiles fall faster with each restart

Rotate and Shuffle Tiles - If you shuffle, then rotate a tile, colour orientation of 
the tile will go back to the original unshuffled position.
